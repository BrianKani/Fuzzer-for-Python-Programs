# Fuzzer for Python Programs

#Overview
This project introduces a customized Python fuzzer designed to enhance code coverage and bug discovery compared to the baseline "Advanced Grey-Box Fuzzer" from the Fuzzing Book. The fuzzer incorporates a novel research concept or implements a prior research contribution in the field of fuzzing, aiming to push the boundaries of automated testing.

#Implementation
The fuzzer, an extension of the provided student fuzzer, integrates innovative concepts to improve its efficiency in generating diverse inputs. It explores advanced techniques for input mutation and coverage-guided feedback mechanisms, striving to discover bugs in Python programs more effectively.

#Example Python Program
To showcase the capabilities of the developed fuzzer, an example Python program is included. This program is carefully crafted to illustrate how the custom fuzzer surpasses the baseline Advanced Grey-Box Fuzzer in terms of identifying bugs and achieving better code coverage.

#Experiments and Results
A series of experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the custom fuzzer compared to the baseline Fuzzing Book fuzzer. The experiments consider random variations in the tools to provide a comprehensive understanding of the benefits and tradeoffs associated with the custom implementation.

#Experimental Setup
Baseline Fuzzer: Advanced Grey-Box Fuzzer from the Fuzzing Book.
Custom Fuzzer: Extended student fuzzer with novel concepts.
Python Programs: Diverse set of Python programs for testing.
Results
The results of the experiments highlight the strengths of the custom fuzzer in terms of code coverage and bug discovery. The tradeoffs are analyzed, considering factors such as execution time, resource utilization, and the adaptability of the fuzzer to different types of programs.

#Report
The accompanying report provides a detailed explanation of the implemented fuzzer, the rationale behind its design choices, and the novel concepts integrated. It also delves into the example Python program, demonstrating how the fuzzer outperforms the baseline. The experimental results are presented with insights into the observed benefits and tradeoffs.

#How to Use
Installation: Clone the repository and follow the instructions in the provided documentation to set up and install the custom fuzzer.

Example Program: Navigate to the "examples" directory to find the example Python program. Run it with the custom fuzzer and compare the results with the baseline.
